# Goose Game
Just a simple game which i made in 1 day.

## How to play
1. Install Python on your computer if you don't have it (If you're using Debian or Debian-based distros like Ubuntu and Mint — open the terminal, print `sudo apt update` and after this print `sudo apt install python`, if you use Ubuntu use `apt-get` instead of `apt`. If your distro is Arch or Arch-based — use `sudo pacman -S python`. If it's openSUSE — use `sudo zypper install python`. If you are using another Linux distro, use your distro package manager to install Python. If your OS is Windows — ~~Install Arch Linux and install it through pacman~~ Just install Python from the official website https://www.python.org/). If you already have installed Python on your computer — good, just skip it.
2. Install **git** on your computer if you don't have it (Same process. Just use package manager of your Linux distro, or install it from official website if your OS is Windows). If you already have installed git on your computer — good, just skip it.
3. Clone my repository. Open your terminal (Linux terminal/konsole/console, or Windows command prompt/PowerShell), now, using the `cd` command you need to select a directory, where you want to install a game, and after this print `git clone git@github.com:PlagueFencer/goosegame.git` or `git clone https://github.com/PlagueFencer/goosegame.git`. *Don't close a terminal after this.*
4. Now, you need to install **pygame**. Print `pip3 install pygame` or `pip install pygame` in your terminal. *Don't close a terminal after this.*
5. Now, print `python3 main.py` or `python main.py` in terminal to open a game
6. Play and enjoy.
